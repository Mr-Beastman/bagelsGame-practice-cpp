# Bagels, a deductive logic game.
## By Al Sweigart

This is my attempt at completing the first program in "The Big Book of Small Pyhton Projects" by Al Sweigart.<br>
<br>
This was an extra challange I set for myself along side studying C++ with Yoobee College of Creative Innovation, to help pratice and drive home what I have been learning. With the added advantage of getting used to github<br>
<br>
These practice projects are made to the best of my knowledge at the time, and I look forward to coming back to them as my knowledge grows. In the mean time any and all feed back is greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day!
